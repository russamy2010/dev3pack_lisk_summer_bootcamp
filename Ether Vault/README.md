Development Steps:
Create SafeMath Library: This library will provide safe arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction) to prevent integer overflows and underflows, which are critical for financial operations.

Define VaultBase Contract:

Include the SafeMath library using using SafeMath for uint256;.

Declare a mapping to track each user's deposited Ether balance.

Define events for Deposit and Withdrawal.

Implement an onlyOwner modifier (a common pattern for access control) and a constructor to set the owner.

Define VaultManager Contract:

Inherit from VaultBase.

Implement the deposit() function, making it payable to receive Ether. It will update the user's balance and emit a Deposit event. It will also check for zero deposits.

Implement the withdraw() function, allowing users to withdraw their deposited Ether. It will check for sufficient balance and prevent over-withdrawal, update the user's balance, and emit a Withdrawal event.

Assumptions and Restrictions:
Ether Only: This vault is designed exclusively for depositing and withdrawing native Ether, not ERC-20 tokens.

No Interest/Yield: This is a simple vault, meaning it does not incorporate any logic for generating interest or yield on deposited funds.

Basic Ownership: The onlyOwner modifier is a simple access control mechanism. For more complex systems, consider OpenZeppelin's Ownable contract.

Direct Withdrawals: Funds are withdrawn directly to the caller's address.

No Pausable/Upgradeable Features: For simplicity, advanced features like pausing the contract or upgradeability are not included.
