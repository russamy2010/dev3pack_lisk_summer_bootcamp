Since foundry uses .toml (foundry.toml) for project wide configuration, it may be necessary to adjust it.

[profile.default]
src = "src"
out = "out"
libs = ["lib"]
test = "test"
script = "script"
# The Solidity compiler version
solc_version = "0.8.20" # Or whatever version you prefer, matching your pragma
optimizer = true
optimizer_runs = 200

# Optional: Set up RPC URLs and Etherscan API keys as environment variables
# RPC_URL = "${RPC_URL}"
# ETHERSCAN_API_KEY = "${ETHERSCAN_API_KEY}"

Note: solc_version should match the pragma in your Solidity files
